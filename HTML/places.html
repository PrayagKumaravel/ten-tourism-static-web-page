                        archaeological site that offers a glimpse into prehistoric human life. These caves, which date

                        The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib, is one of the holiest and most iconic religious
                        sites for Sikhs, located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. Built in the 16th century by Guru Arjan
                        Dev, the temple is renowned for its stunning architecture, with its upper floors covered in gold
                        leaf, giving it its name. The Golden Temple is set within a large man-made pool, known as the
                        Amrit Sarovar, believed to have healing properties. The temple’s serene beauty, combined with
                        its spiritual significance, makes it a major pilgrimage destination for Sikhs and visitors from
                        all over the world. Inside, the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, is
                        continuously recited. The Golden Temple also stands as a symbol of equality and selfless
                        service, with its community kitchen, or langar, offering free meals to thousands of people
                        daily, regardless of their background. The tranquil atmosphere and the temple’s rich history
                        make it a symbol of devotion, peace, and unity.
